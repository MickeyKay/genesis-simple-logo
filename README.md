A common issue with the Genesis Framework is that it's complicated for users to add their own logo. This plugin attempts to solve this problem by adding a Logo uploader to the WordPress customizer panel. The logo added is fully responsive and has been tested with most of the offical StudioPress themes.

## Features

* Easily add a logo to your Genesis theme without writing any code.
* Responsive design which adapts well to mobile devices.
* Change the width and height of your logo directly within the customizer.

## Settings

All settings are handled within the WordPress customizer interface. You can upload an image and adjust the width and height of your logo in real-time.
